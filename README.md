# FLOOD-DETECTION-AND-FUTURE-RISK-PREDICTION

Flooding is a recurring and devastating natural disaster, causing significant damage to property, infrastructure, and human life, particularly in regions like Tamil Nadu. Traditional flood management systems often lack the capability for timely and precise forecasting. This project proposes the development of an Integrated Flood Detection and Future Risk Prediction System that leverages the synergy of a real-time sensor network and advanced machine learning algorithms. The system is designed to collect critical environmental data including rainfall intensity, water levels, and soil moisture from strategically deployed low-cost sensors. This data, augmented with meteorological information from external APIs, will feed into a predictive model to accurately assess and forecast flood risks. The primary objective is to create a robust, cost-effective early warning system that provides actionable intelligence to authorities and communities through a user-friendly web interface, thereby mitigating the impact of floods.
